kinect-breaker
===============

kinect-breaker is actually a clone of the original Atari hit "Breakout" which ran on the Atari 2600. It was written in about 4 hours as part of a hackathon, but we thought it was good enough to publish. While we keep to the original rules,
we added a few touches of our own. Most noticeably, you can play the game with a few different inputs:
* Xbox Kinect
* Windows Phone
* Remote Web Browser
* Local Web Browser
